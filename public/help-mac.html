<h1>Why Edna?</h1>
<p>Edna is optimized for speed of note taking.</p>
<p>We have keyboard shortcuts for quickly navigating between blocks and notes.</p>
<p>We have syntax highlighting for markdown and multiple programming languages.</p>
<h1>Blocks and notes</h1>
<p>Each note consists of multiple blocks. They are like sub-notes so that you can divide your scratchpad into logical parts.</p>
<p>Each block has its own type for syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>You can efficiently move between blocks, create new blocks and delete them with keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<h1>Multiple notes</h1>
<p>You can create multiple notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>default, always available note is 'scratch'. Press <code>Alt-1</code> to quickly switch to it</li>
<li>press '⌘ + O' to switch to another note or create / delete a note</li>
<li>or click on the note name in the bottom left corner</li>
</ul>
<p>It's up to you to how to divide your writing into blocks and notes.</p>
<p>A <code>scratch</code> note is always available and cannot be deleted.</p>
<h1>Daily journal</h1>
<p>By default we create a 'daily journal' note.</p>
<p>Daily journal is for keeping track of what you do daily.</p>
<p>By convention each block represents a day.</p>
<p>We recommend that first line is date in the format: <code>#YYYY-MM-DD &lt;day of week&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We automatically create a new block for each day when you open journal note.</p>
<p>You can delete it if you don't want to use it.</p>
<h1>Accessing notes on multiple devices</h1>
<p>You can login with GitHub and we'll store the notes as GitHub gists. They will be encrypted with a password.</p>
<h1>Privacy and security</h1>
<p>Your notes are private and secure.</p>
<p>Your notes are stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>locally in the browser if you don't login with GitHub</li>
<li>encrypted with a password if you login with GitHub. The password is only stored in the browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is <a href="">open source</a> so you can audit it.</p>
<p>In Markdown blocks, lists with [x] and [ ] are rendered as checkboxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Try out Edna</li>
<li>[ ] Do laundry</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a Math block. Here, rows are evaluated as math expressions.</p>
<p>radius = 5
area = radius^2 * PI
sqrt(9)</p>
<p>It also supports some basic unit conversions, including currencies:</p>
<p>13 inches in cm
time = 3900 seconds to minutes
time * 2</p>
<p>1 EUR in USD</p>
<p>// this is a javascript block
let x = 5
console.log(&quot;x is&quot;, x)</p>
